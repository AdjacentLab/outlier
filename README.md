# A repository of things related to the Outlier rule 

(work in progress)

The Outlier is a transition rule for 2D binary cellular automata. Self Please refer to the paper for additional details.

The three part video documents the entire lifecycle originating from a single 3x3 seed, as depicted in Figure 4 of the paper.
The 2048x2048 H265-encoded movie is split into 3 parts. I recommend the first part to be watched initially.

### Paper
#### Self-Replicating Hierarchical Structures Emerge in a Binary Cellular Automaton
**Abstract**: We have discovered a novel transition rule for binary cellular automata (CA)
that yields self-replicating structures across two spatial and temporal scales from
sparsely populated random initial conditions. Lower-level, shapeshifting clusters
frequently follow a transient attractor trajectory, generating new clusters, some
of which periodically self-duplicate. When the initial distribution of live cells is
sufficiently sparse, these clusters coalesce into larger formations that also self-replicate. These formations may further form the boundaries of an expanding
complex on an even larger scale. This rule, dubbed “Outlier,” is rotationally
symmetric and applies to 2D Moore neighborhoods. It was evolved through
Genetic Programming during an extensive automated search for rules that foster
open-ended evolution in CA. While self-replicating structures, both crafted and
emergent, have been created in CA with state sets intentionally designed for
this purpose, the Outlier may be the first known rule to facilitate emergent self-replication across two spatial scales in simple binary CA.
